                    <p>
                        Hi! I am Swapneel, a Graduate Mechanical Engineering student at Columbia University pursuing a specialisation in Robotics and Control. I've worked as a robotics engineer for 2 years at Augmentus and have recieved my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from NTU.
                         I have over 3 years of internship, research and full time experience in the development and maintenance of robotic software. I am a fast and willing learner, demonstrating expertise in engineering technologies, programming languages, and engineering principles, with a proven ability to create, optimize, and manage software applications for robotic systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         I'm looking for projects involving work in intelligent robotic manipulation which allow me to develop my knowledge base further in articulated robot manipulation in a dynamic environment, where I can put my prior knowledge to use and also gain valuable experience and new skills in cutting edge robotics development.

                            Developed code for integrating camera feed features in a human-machine interface for a construction site stair-climbing robot.
                            Conducted a literature review of existing image stitching methods to achieve 360-degree views for automobiles and robots with fish-eye cameras, and sourced appropriate fish-eye cameras for the project.
                            Carried out image stitching to achieve 360-degree views and prepared frames for individual directional camera feeds as well.

                            Programmed the IRB120 Robot for automated plastic waste sorting on a conveyor belt based on classification data. The classification data was provided by a hybrid
                            AI system comprising a TeraHertz Sensor and Computer Vision. Supported the AI team in developing the classification based on the CV side, and also helped integrate the camera system as well as supporting mechatronic devices with the robot.
                            Developed a live Digital Twin of the system in RViz, with metrics on plastic types and picking rate.

                            Designed and prototyped the robot that won the Mechatronics System Design Course robot competition at NTU.
                            The objective was to design a robot that can compete in an arena with another robot to locate tennis balls in the arena and return them to a designated drop-off point.
                            Took  charge of the motion programming and search strategy for the competing robots as well as for the tennis balls in the arena. Also supported the sensor integration to the Microcontroller to read the correct signals on arena boundary limits, ball pickup status, and drop-off status.
                            All programming was done on the Vex Microcontroller that was used as the brain of the robot.
